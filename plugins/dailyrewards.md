# Daily Rewards 
You want to know how you can earn your daily reward. We are going to show you how to achieve that. 

## To gain your reward

To receive your reward you are going to enter the command `/reward` into the command box. You should receive the item(s) and a notification that you received the items through the notification in the chat. 

### Daily Reset

The daily reset is 24 hours after you claimed your reward. We do not reset the daily cooldown. The cooldown is from the time you entered the command. 

_For Example:_ If you entered the `/reward` command at 8 pm then you need to wait until 8 pm the next night to enter `/reward` to receive your item.

## Welcome to Evil Ninjas Minecraft Information

Back in 1800, Miners were getting bored with mining. The news spread through the villages near the borders of Kawa.Kawa citizens got together to come up with ideas on how to make building fun. All the citizens gave ideas, but all have failed to work. Although, this was until Evil Ninjas came along. Evil Ninjas were from the Hara Mountains. In Hara, the mountains were so harsh to build on that it took skills to develop. Evil Ninjas found ways to keep creating fun as they enjoyed to design. Hara structures were built along the mountains using all resources available near the village.

After hearing the news, Evil Ninjas embarked on the journey to help the miners find fun in mining. Evil Ninjas came with all tools, materials, and members to teach the miners skills, humor, and imagination. The ninjas always believed in: Creativity is endless as long as you allow your mind to be free. They taught this to the miners on a daily basis. They would start with a small building while moving up to more significant structures. In the end, Evil Ninjas have given miners the ability to think of new structures that kept them entertained.
